# KangEmporium (In Progress)
E-commerce website I'm in the process of building for a professional friend. Has a login/register page managed by Firebase.
Working on the backend to serve the products in NodeJS using MongoDb.
Uses redux to manage cart state.

# Technologies used:
* React
* Firebase Auth
* Redux Toolkit
* React-lottie-player
* Material UI
* TailwindCSS (Favorite)

# What did I learn (In Progress)
This was my first e-commerce website (what took so long! .. I know right). Continued to learn and improve with TailwindCSS positioning elements.
Used Lottie Player for loading, sign in success and failure animations. Improved my grasp of Redux, creating reducers to add/remove items from cart
or increase quantity of an item in the cart.

# Hurdles Overcome (In Progress)
* Get a working model of the app

# Still to do
* Implement Backend to serve products from (waiting on product list with descriptions and price and such from friend).
* Improve UI/UX, make mobile responsive.
* Create a Stripe Payment Server to implement CheckOut Screen.
